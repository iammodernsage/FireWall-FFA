This is an open source & a free for all web application firewall program.

 #Intro
  ## The objective of this project to protect web applications across the Internet from looming cyber threats
  ## The market for WAF is a bit dull and annoying, which makes many developers, and CSRs anxious.
  ## This project shall work on filling in the gaps that make web applications vulnerable to cyber threats
  ## It's a well established fact that developing a 100% secure application is just a hoax. Hence, this project focuses on making applications a safe ground for users, there can be much more aspects to it; for now, I am leaving at it.

 #Features
  ## This project is written in C & python (majorly).
  ## It is a modular, lightweight, open-source firewall that anyone can freely integrate into their own web applications, servers, or frameworks.
  ## The project will be easy to extend via Python plugins.
  ## It should have command-line usage and should be API ready.
  ## No telemetry, no lock-in (Need to work a bit more on this one).

This is an open source & a free for all web application firewall program.

 ## Intro

  - The objective of this project to protect web applications across the Internet from looming cyber threats
  - The market for WAF is a bit dull and annoying, which makes many developers, and Cyber Security Researchers anxious.
  - This project shall work on filling in the gaps that make web applications vulnerable to cyber threats
  - It's a well established fact that developing a 100% secure application is just a hoax. Hence, this project focuses on making applications a safe ground for users, there can be much more aspects to it; for now, I am leaving at it.

 ## Features 

(This is just a pilot, the project is under development, the original features will include many more functionalities)

  - This project is written in C & python (majorly).
  - It is a modular, lightweight, open-source firewall that anyone can freely integrate into their own web applications, servers, or frameworks.
  - The project will be easy to extend via Python plugins.
  - It should have command-line usage and should be API ready.
  - No telemetry, no lock-in (Need to work a bit more on this one).

## Initial Release 27/06/2025

 - The initial phase of this project has been completed, which includes basic structure & reliable functionalities of the firewall.
 - There are more advanced features available with this project which needs to be integrated. All the files can be found in their respective folders (see developer guide for more info).
 - The main focus areas of this project will now be decentralization, addition of advanced features like blocking of various cyber threats, & much more (need to work on a few things first: like AI & ML).
 - Basic features for decentralization do exist in the current phase, but it is a standalone feature for now.
